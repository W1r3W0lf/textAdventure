# Text Adventure Game Engine requirements


## Portability
The software should be able to run on any POSIX compatible system and compiled to run under a Windows system.


## Expand-ability
The software should have an easy to use way to modify and expand the game.
There should be a way for the user to be able to place a file/folder inside of a game's data that will modify how the game works.


## Licensing

I am split between the GNU GPL3, the GNU LGPL, and the BSD 3 clause license.

I am leaning more to using the GNU GPL3. But I don't want to force games made in this Engine also to have there source code avalable.


## Appearance

The software should display text that the user will respond to. After the user responds to that text the given text and response should be moved above the new text and response prompt.
This should apply repeatedly and the user should be able to scroll up to see older responses.


## Input

The software should receive text input though a terminal and should echo what the user types back to them at the bottom of the terminal screen.
